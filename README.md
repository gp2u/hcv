HCV Decision Support

The purpose of this tool is to provide a simple user interface to navigate the upcoming Australian HCV treatment Guidelines which are by necessity limited to dealing with the PBS listed medications Sofosbuvir, Ledipasvir, Daclatasvir and Ribavirin.

The intention is to also support the AASLD and EASL guidelines which have a wider scope.

The tool consists of an Object Oriented Framework that should be self explanatory to most programmers.

You can find a demonstration at https://gp2u.com.au/hcv

Public contributions are welcome.

1) SVR Statistics and comments in the code referencing them
2) Addition of medications like Abbvie Viekira Pak
3) The AASLD and EASL guideline code
4) Support for past treatment status
5) Validation of existing algorithms like kPA and Hepascore to F

For simplicity everything is contained in a single standalone HTML file.
